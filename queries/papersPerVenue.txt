This plot shows the number of papers published over the years by major
venues (those with at least 800 papers published, according to our dataset).

In recent years, Bioinformatics could be considered one of the most influential
venue due to its consistently higher number of papers published compared to others.
IEEE venues, are the most prominent in the fields of information and tecnology.

For instance, on 2009, the research community focused more on the field of
communication.
That same year, the Physics Nobel Prize was awarded for "groundbreaking achievements
concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication".
