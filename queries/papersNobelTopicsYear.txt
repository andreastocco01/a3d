This query shows the topics present in both Nobel motivations and paper abstracts.
For a given year, it returns the number of paper in which these topics appear.
This query can be used to find correlations between Nobel Prize topics and research
papers.

For instance, running this query for the year 2004 shows that the topic "protein"
appeared in 28 papers. Hence, we could say that in 2004 chemistry was the main
research field (considering the limited number of papers available) and that the
main topic of the Nobel Prize awarded in that year was studied by several
researcher.

Unfortunately, this query is not always useful. In some cases, the
main topics may include words like "method" and "analysis", which are not
informative enough to determine how extensively a specific topic was studied
in a given year.

Due to the distribution of research papers in our dataset across different years,
this query provides more meaningful results for years after 2000.
