With this query, we identified the top three countries with the highest number of Nobel laureates born there,
along with the annual amount of funding allocated to research and development (R&D) by these nations.
To ensure data consistency, we focused exclusively on the years from 2000 to 2016.

[plots/laureates_comparison_by_country.png]

The graphs reveal a strong correlation between R&D funding and the number of Nobel laureates. In particular,
the United States dominates both metrics, demonstrating how substantial investments in research directly
contribute to significant achievements in this field, resulting in a higher number of laureates annually.

The situation in Great Britain, highlighted in the following plot, further supports this observation:

Itâ€™s clear that the trends in funding and the number of laureates mirror each other closely. From 2001 to 2003,
we observe the same pattern in both metrics. Subsequently, a steady and low level of R&D funding resulted in a
consistent number of British Nobel laureates until 2016, when a sharp increase in Nobel prizes coincided with
a significant rise in R&D investments.
